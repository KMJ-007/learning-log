so want to learn how react works under the hood, and how i can create my own react!

because, by doing this i will be able to improve things in my ongoing project!

for now decided to follow this:
https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/

i know they maintain two dom tree, compare the changes, and only update the changed component
