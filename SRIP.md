Title: Development of High-density Cost Effective BCI apparatus

  

Description : Objectives of the project

  

To develop a low-cost high density Electroencephalogram setup that can

● Record EEG signals at high sampling rates with accuracy on par with existing research standards (calibrated with available EEG headset).

● Allow easy wireless synchronization with custom python and Matlab applications

● Function with in-house developed electrodes

  

Project Overview

  

Brain-computer Interface devices have shown promise in various applications ranging from rehabilitation, control of prosthetics and neuro-feedback. Although existing devices can accurately and non-invasively record brain signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) (which are an integral part of most BCI applications), these are expensive and beyond the reach of the average consumer. Existing low-cost alternatives tend to give inaccurate measurements. Moreover, they may also require the use of rigid licensed software for acquisition making it difficult to synchronize with custom applications.

  

Interestingly, the main Data acquisition block's electronic components are relatively affordable when compared to the complete device. This makes the prospect of putting together a cost-effective BCI setup realistically feasible. This project aims to set up an affordable, wireless EEG headset that can provide accurate signals by using custom-designed electrodes, connectors and codes and validate it against a research-grade device.

  

Pre-requisites

  

1) Background in circuit design and testing

2) Background in signal processing

3) Basics of instrumentation

4) Understanding of programming in Python and Matlab

5) Basic understanding and experience of integrating devices over wired and wireless networks (WiFi and Bluetooth)

6) Experience in soldering

  

Expected Deliverables

  

● To configure OpenBci DAC with daisy chaining to record data from 64 channels simultaneously.

● To design (and 3D print) and test low-cost high quality custom electrodes

● To program necessary software for data acquisition

● To setup a BCI application using a standard device and the in-house headset

● Perform a comparative analysis between the standard device and the in-house headset

  

Learning outcomes

  

● Integration and synchronization of data from different wireless devices

● EEG data acquisition and processing

● BCI application development

● Basics of 3D printing
