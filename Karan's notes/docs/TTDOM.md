The main idea behind this side project was to learn more about how virtual dom works, and how frameworks like React, vue does the magic behind the scene ?

let's start from basic

- imagining there are no frameworks, nothing exist, we are going in way back, when just html was invented and WWW was written and after few years css was invented ![](www.png)
- and tbh, sites which were made using just these combos were so dope, i really like the design and aesthetics of it

[[design]] is really great, the evolution is worth looking, i still think lot of innovation or peak of things were done in early 90 and 20, with limited resources, from ray tracing, doom and many more things,  they pushed boundary really far, compared to today where we have this many resources and power
