i see lot of my age starting a startup speaking about it on twitter, i sometimes feel fomo tbh,

but as i am learning and exploring and things are making little sense, i think just starting a startup to look cool, then shutting it down, is not so cool, it may be considered achievement to raise money from VC, it may be i don't know,

i think it is long term game, if anyone want to start startup, it is long commitment, like 6-10 years at least, to see some worthwhile result, you need to give time to see the magic happen, and this is where burn out happens, they start the startup, in the starting they work, but they burn out,

i think(so far what i have read and experience) that joining other startup who is at very early stage, where there is more room, you can do lot of things, and learning is lot, is good option to consider, working on big company is not, things should move fast, you or your team should move things fast, ambition should fall from ecstasy 

startup vibe is not that much cool, project vibe is more cool, we are just few guys working on this project
