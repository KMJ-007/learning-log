## B2B sass for manufacturer or hardware guyes who works on scale and have large team and more than one projects at the same time
 - hardware shiping of new version of product is not simple as just clicking on release button or fixing patch like we do in the software
 - they need to go through lot of haessel, lot of review, from design to getting prototype, from ordering the parts from supplier, the main issue is the life of the guy who is handling the operations, and he needs to also know the status of other four things or team members
 - a typical hardware projects consist of hardware, electrical, software(simple firmware or android/ios apps ), design
 - in software we have git, which is boon it self, like undoing a brush stroke or watching whole painting is awesome thing, if we can also provide simillar magic to operation guyes, so they can also better anyals the past decision, reviewing each other works, who is working on what, can help a lot, from browsing the first version of prototype design, this thing is beautiful experiance
 - and it is becoming standard that at this scale, the team works on predefined softwares like autocad or solid works, or any other industary standard, if those software can seamlessly integreated with the system, their life is more chill and good, no back and forth for the team
 - ux of tally and aesthetics of linear will be killer combo and how can i forgot about creating power user ecosystem like excel
 - creating one bill of materials and other things which can be created on the past data
- directly sharing bill of materials to supplier or vendor in one click
- simillar software which are there but didn't saw in indian market or i haven't researched  enough: [config](https://config.com/)

## extension that gives you the codebase history like time machine
- i really like the git, it is very beautiful thing
- using it we can go in any history to other alternative pathways, or we can build many reality's at the same time and merge them together, whenever we want, and other people also can help you in this
- recently replit(really love what they are doing) released this tweet, which is somewhat i was also thinking
- {{<tweet "https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1664724287473827842?s=20">}}
- want to play with this idea, and replit is good, i use it for quick experiments where i don't need to setup environment, but i still use vscode, i need this kind of thing in my vscode
- i want to build similarx
