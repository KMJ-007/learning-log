so the current browser sucks in terms of doing research and doing any kind of rabbit hole exploration

i like following features and some mixes of the software which i am using it for long time

- i should be able to maintain the trail of the research i am doing
- integrating git like thing, but it should be very easy to use,
- curius like community and where people can share their ideas thoughts and trail which they are going on
- dynamic selection based links
- should be very good for AI/ scientific research things
- command palete way of interacting things, mouse seems very inefficient way of doing things


what can mvp look like:
- where i can create trails, name them, and go through them and visualise it, horiznotal scrolling
