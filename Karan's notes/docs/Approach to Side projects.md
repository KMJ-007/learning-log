- was listing to linus lee podcast, have been following him from so long
- he talks about how overambitious side projects don't get completed, because they are sometimes involved with too many unknowns, and people end up not completing it or streching the project
- his approach is working with what you know already and adding one unknown at a time, and developing in deadline or picking up the projects which can be done in shorter amount of time, with the time you end up creating your own tools and projects ecosystem which makes process faster
- shipping more things is the key, and if you want to ship faster too many unknowns can slow you down
