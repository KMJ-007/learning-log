so there are two options
1. p5.js
2. processing
- first one is based on javascript, and other one is based on java, 

so i am going with p5 for now, because main reason is i want to share my sketches through sites, by processing i have to post images and videos, in longer time i will be adding interaction part to my sketches for that this is required,

following this thing to clear my doubt for choosing between this framwork:

and now starting with p5.js with this blog:
https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/

i already know javascript and have worked with p5 in the past, so starting portion will be speedrun!

i have taken workshops also on this, but they were very basic just intro, so want to deep dive in!
